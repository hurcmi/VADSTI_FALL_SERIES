# Module 4: Data Exploration and Visualization

This module provides recipes for exploratory data analysis and data visualization which are a critical step in any data science project. The goal of this module is to learn how to visualize and perform initial investigations of the data so as to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypothesis, and check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

The learning objectives of this module are:

## Workshop 1

* Python refresher (Optional)
* Getting familiar with Pandas library
* Pandas Exercise
* Data visualization using matplotlib, plotly, and seaborn library
* Data visualization exercise


## Workshop 2
* Using python to explore, filter, and manipulate the UCI diabetes dataset
    - Identify data anomalies and missingness
    - Learn how to impute datasets
    - Identify highly correlated variables
* Data Exploration Exercise
* Explore the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 data repository and import the data.
    - Wrangle the data to look at the number of reported confirmed cases by country and regions.
    - Plot the number of reported confirmed cases by country 
    - Plot the number of reported death cases by country
